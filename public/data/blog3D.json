      "title": "Building Blocks of the Virtual World: Deep Learning of 3D Model Creation",
      "description": "<p>The field of 3D generative modeling is experiencing a paradigm shift, marked by innovative approaches such as leveraging point clouds, normalizing flow in latent spaces, and adopting progressive decoding techniques. For this phenomenon to flourish, in-depth understanding is crucial for the market to be accepted. With the help of this article, recent research papers proposing novel methodologies, challenges faced, and potential enhancements in the realm of 3D generative models will be explored. It is important to note that these advancements align with and can contribute to projects like the Holosnap initiative by The KOW Company, aiming to create a dedicated space for AI-driven 3D outputs.</p>\n        <h3>3D Model creation with Deep Learning Techniques</h3>\n        <p>Imagine a collection of ordinary images that you capture on your smartphone. Ever wanted to see these images from different angles like when viewing a photo of your favorite pet, clothes, shoes, or a stunning vacation scene? This is now possible within a short time with the technology of 3D reconstruction through deep learning. The impact of this technology is profound. For example, in online shopping, 3D reconstruction enables you to examine products from every angle, making sure they meet your expectations before purchasing. Therefore, 3D reconstruction from 2D images through deep learning serves as a transformative tool, enabling new ways of engaging with the world around us for shopping, or exploration, etc.</p>\n        <div class=\"blogFullImg\">\n            <img src=\"/img/3d/blog/programming-background-with-html-text.webp\" class=\"img-1\" alt=\"blog-image\" />\n            <img src=\"/img/3d/blog/programming-background-with-html-text.webp\" class=\"img-2\" alt=\"blog-image\"/>\n        </div> \n        <h3>Understanding Point Clouds in 3D Generative Models:</h3>\n        <p>Point clouds, as rich geometric data structures, serve as an excellent domain for understanding representation learning and generative modeling in 3D space. Recent research focuses on training generative models capable of generating sets of points that resemble previously learned 3D objects. However, the permutation invariance of point clouds, achieved through max pooling, neglects intricate point relationships. To address this, transformer encoders are proposed to capture complex point relationships, thereby improving reconstruction and training performance.</p>\n        <h3>Progressive Decoding for Complex Object Generation:</h3>\n        <p>The decoding process from the latent space code plays a pivotal role in the generative performance of 3D models. Instead of relying on traditional multi-layer perceptron decoders, recent proposals advocate for progressive decoding models. By decoding 3D point clouds progressively and conditioning on already generated points, this approach aims to generate more complex and realistic objects. This stepwise generation process is anticipated to facilitate the creation of intricate 3D structures.</p>\n        <h3>Holosnap Project: A Bridge to Real-world Applications:</h3>\n        <p>In the context of 3D generative models, the Holosnap project by The KOW Company is a noteworthy initiative. Holosnap envisions creating a dedicated space for the output of AI-generated 3D models. By acknowledging such projects, the article underlines the importance of bridging the gap between cutting-edge research in 3D generative modeling and practical applications.</p>\n        <h3>Holosnap's Objective: Outlining our Future Direction</h3>\n        <p>Holosnap's objective is to transform a collection of 2D images or a single 360-degree video, regardless of resolution, into a detailed 3D model. Currently, we can create a point cloud from just one image. A point cloud is a set of data points in space, representing a 3D shape or object. Each point in the cloud represents a specific part of the object, like dots that, when connected, form a full picture.</p>\n        <p>Taking advantage of generative AI, Holosnap enhances this process by creating a 360-degree view from a single image. However, our goal is to streamline the conversion of real 2D images to 3D models, making this technology accessible to a broader audience. By reducing the number of images required for conversion and allowing for manual post-processing, we aim to significantly cut down on both the time and costs associated with traditional 3D modeling.</p>",
